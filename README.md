Hi, my name is Jessie. I recently graduated as a computer science major from Hunter College. Passionate about problem solving and fulfilling career goals, I am an ambitious person. My experience involves largely of frontend; however, I would like to develop my backend skills as well. Since entering college and taking my first computer science class, I envisioned myself working in the tech industry, assisting with technical problems. Days after, I have always enjoyed creating successful programs with an output. Evidently, this class led my love for computer science to grow stronger. For instance, I became a teaching assistant for this class with 700+ students, allowing me to fully experience tech firsthand. In general, technology is an ever-growing field with no stopping points. With hard work and passion, making a small impact will eventually be a stepping stone to future tech milestones. As a woman in tech, I know and want to make an impact.

I'm excited for you to see some of my recent projects!!
